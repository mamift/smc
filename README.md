# SMC (Simple Managed Compiler)

This repo is a copy of the *smc* source code that shipped with the .NET Framework SDK v1.1 from the year 2001.

It's a very featured implementation of a subset of C++ that compiles down to CIL (managed) code. Most notably is that the compiler is self-hosting: and able to compile its own source code.
